OCTOBER 2021

10-19-2021
Resuming project after med school app hiatus. Met with Alexis to touchbase on project status & next steps. Discussed first optimizing a single parameter value (promoter A strength) instead of all promoters. Created python script 'mini_optimization_pA'. 

10-20-2021
@check terminator locations

10-26-2021
Continuing work on mini_optimization_pA. Finished get_error() function to calculate RMSE. Started work on wrapper() which will implement hill climbing algorithm to optimize pA. 
@check terminator locations

10-29-2021
Received feedback from Alexis on 'mini_optimization_pA': 
1) Add doc strings for each function
2) Add comments for values hardcoded/source
3) gnu parallel = command line utility, use this to run stuff on pod; Turn this into a python script that takes a command=line variable & use gnu parallel to run it on the pod; Create a text file with param values --> bash script. 

Discussed whether to 1) treat pA,pB,pD as distinct, independent parameters OR 2) whether to assume the relative fold change experimentally recorded across all promoters will inform their relative binding strengths. Will proceed with Option 2. 

@Alexis will send an example script of how to use gnu parallel

Tried to scale promoter strengths using fold-change relationship. Dead end, resulted in wildly wrong distribution...will try to rerun with different starting points. Created 'weird_pt_errors.py" to find issues with pinetree. Also finally fixed terminator positions.

@Clean up scripts & files, change names 
    *on run_pt() function, add an argument that allows user to create a folder to store that specific set of runs. Will help keep different trials more organized.
@Try running mini_optimization_pA.py with scaled promoter values & find different stepping points.

Spent some time reconsolidating my work to assess where I am in this project. 
*completed, ~in progress, ^future

    AIM 1: Recapitulate Gene Expression patterns in wildtype PhiX-174
        a) *Created script to parse genebank file, extract genomic coordinates, and linearize circular genome (parsing_genebank)
        
        b) *Created script to run pinetree using linearized genomic coordinates; manually toggled parameter values (phiX174_optimization) 
        
        c) *Implement Hill Climbing algorithm to optimize 1 parameter (mini_optimization)
        
        d) ~repeat Hill Climbing to optimize each paramter individually 
        
        e) ~optimize multiple parameters w/ step idea
        
        
    AIM 2: Capture change in viral fitness after genomic modularization 
        a) ~write script that calculates fitness from transcript levels using stoichiometric relationships (Leuven 2020)
        
        b) ^linearize genome & remove overlapping features (Wright 2020) and find change in fitness. 
        
        
    AIM 3: Capture change in viral fitness after whole codon deoptimization
        a) ^Extract amino acid sequences for each gene from genebank file 
        b) Play with transcription rates/weights applied to the genes to mimic deoptimized codon usage

Met with Claus and Alexis to review project aims; removing Aim 3 because of challenges modeling tRNA behavior. Focus on Aims 1 & 2. Discussed new optimization strategy using normal distributions for each parameter. See written research notes for details.
