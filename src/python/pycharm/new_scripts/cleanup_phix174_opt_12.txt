Things to clean up in phix174_opt_12.py script:

1. Update location of genomic_coords.
  b) In next implementation (once circular genome is available) will need to update this coords file OR pull directly from the original ENSEMBLE file

2. Discuss how to specify pinetree simulation output directory in the README file.

4. Update get_error() function, ie how RMSE is calculated.
  a) Claus' feedback with setting gA expression levels --> 1000 transcripts & fitting accordingly.

7. Write bash file to generate jobs.txt file

COMPLETED:

1. Update location of genomic_coords.
    a) Move into ...pycharm/6032022 --> created variable called 'genomic_coords_path'; add this to the main function call & pinetree call

3. Remove unnecessary print statements littered throughout the code

5. Make number of generations also a parameter (ie don't hardcode 500)

6. Fix scaling the promoter values (simplify so ~N(1, 0.1)). Currently, code looks as shown in a) and b)
  a) step = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 1)[0]
  b) pA = pA * (step + 1)
