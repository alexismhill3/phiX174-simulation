    "### Optimizing promoter strengths for phix-174\n",
    "In this script, I will optimize the promoter strengths for each of the three promoter sites in Phix_174. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Idea\n",
    "1. Define a unique normal distribution (**~N(u,o)**) for each of the three promoters (pA, pB, pD). Let the promoter strength be **e^u_value** and step size be the st. deviation **o**. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a normal distribution (**~N(0.5,?)**) to describe **lambda**. Here, **lambda** represents the value by which the step size will be scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Randomly select a promoter to optimize (pA, pB, pD). Feed promoter values into pinetree & calculate RMSE. If the new error (**NE**) is less than the old error (**OE**), then keep the promoter value. If not, increment the promoter value by the step size (add **e^o**). Keep repeating with randomly selected **o** value until **NE** < **OE**. *Stop after 5 iterations & move onto the next promoter value.*\n",
