Things to clean up in phix174_opt_12.py script:

1. Update README - describe how everything required to run simulations & optimizations are in Wilke/tingle/phix174/src/python/pycharm/new_scripts

2. Write bash file to generate jobs.txt file

3. Tidy simulation code for decompressed genome. 

4. Write script to generate decompressed_genomic_coords.csv - make this distinction cleaner

5. Make decompressed scripts
6. Make decompressed genome files
7. Make decompressed jobs file generator
8. Make parallel.sh scripts for dc
9. Fix genomic coords fro both write_jobs_wt and main script and in the output files. 
10. Rename files so all wt and dc are grouped togethe

COMPLETED:

1. Update location of genomic_coords.
    a) Move into ...pycharm/6032022 --> created variable called 'genomic_coords_path'; add this to the main function call & pinetree call

2. Remove unnecessary print statements littered throughout the code

3. Make number of generations also a parameter (ie don't hardcode 500)

4. Fix scaling the promoter values (simplify so ~N(1, 0.1)). Currently, code looks as shown in a) and b)
  a) step = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 1)[0]
  b) pA = pA * (step + 1)

5. Update get_error() function, ie how RMSE is calculated.
  a) Claus' feedback with setting gA expression levels --> 10 transcripts & fitting accordingly.

6. Update location of genomic_coords.
  b) In next implementation (once circular genome is available) will need to update this coords file OR pull directly from the original ENSEMBLE file
