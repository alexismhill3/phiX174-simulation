Resuming project after med school app hiatus. Met with Alexis to touchbase on project status & next steps. Discussed first optimizing a single parameter value (promoter A strength) instead of all promoters. Created python script 'mini_optimization_pA' to write this code. Finished coding the run_pt(gen,pA) function.
